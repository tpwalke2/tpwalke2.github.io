I've worked in enterprise web development for 16+ years. Early on I worked on the LAMP stack, but I'm most familiar with Windows, .NET, and SQL Server.

Check out my [Github][github] profile to see some of the projects I have worked on. Or get in touch on [LinkedIn][linkedin].

My [intent] with this blog is to document solutions to obscure problems I encounter. The hope is that I remember to check here first if I run into them again, but also to help anyone else that may be struggling with the same problem.

Any opinions expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of my employer.
