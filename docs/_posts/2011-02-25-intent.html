Sometimes <a href="http://twitter.com/tpwalke2">140 characters</a> just isn't enough space. Sometimes I want to post about things that don't really fit with <a href="http://www.thewalkerramble.com/">my family blog</a>. This is a place for such topics.<br /><br />I am a software engineer by day. I am paid to solve problems on computers. A lot of problems that I run into have already been solved and Google helps me to not reinvent the wheel. Nevertheless, I do occasionally run into questions that do not have a readily available answer (namely the first few pages of a <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google search</a>).<br /><br />My intent with this blog is to post primarily about computer programming topics. I reserve the right to occasionally differ. I also do not commit to a regular posting schedule.
