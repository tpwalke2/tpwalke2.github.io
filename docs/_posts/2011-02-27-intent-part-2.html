I use a number of different programming languages and technologies depending on what I am currently working on. Some projects have requirements that lend themselves to one technology or language over another. You will be able to determine which language or technology I'm working with based on what the post contains in it. I will post code samples in the language I am using at the time I have a blog post idea.
