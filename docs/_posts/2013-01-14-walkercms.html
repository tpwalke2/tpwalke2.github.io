<p>In working on some websites for friends, I found a need for a fairly simple CMS. These sites are mostly just collections of static content that needed a common look-and-feel. Because of the mostly static nature, I didnâ€™t feel that a heavyweight CMS was worth the effort.</p> <p>Instead, I reinvented the wheel and wrote my own. It is available as an <a href="https://github.com/tpwalke2/WalkerCMS">open-source project</a> on GitHub.</p>
