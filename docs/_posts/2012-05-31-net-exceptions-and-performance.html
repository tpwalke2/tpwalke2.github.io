<p>I had an application that was performing very poorly under a fairly heavy load out in the real world. It got me thinking about doing more performance testing, both within a profiler and under simulated loads. The profiler pointed out some key flaws in the code that were quickly dispatched, but the problems still remained.</p>  <p>I enlisted some help to simulate more realistic loads and really stressed out the application and I started getting errors that I shouldn’t have been getting. So I thought. The code that was generating the errors wasn’t thread-safe. In an effort to reduce the number of error emails I was receiving, I surrounded the offending code with SyncLocks and the errors stopped.</p>  <p>A side benefit was that the performance issues went away. It was then that I discovered that <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11265/Performance-implications-of-Exceptions-in-NET">exceptions can cause</a> some performance hits due to the extra objects required.</p>  <p>So, if you can help it, minimize exceptions (I could in this case) and watch for thread-safety in code that may be run with multiple threads.</p>
