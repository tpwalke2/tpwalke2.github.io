I have a <a href="http://www.seagate.com/">Seagate</a> <a href="http://www.seagate.com/www/en-us/products/external/freeagent/">FreeAgent</a> external drive to help with backups.<br /><br />About 2 weeks ago, the nightly backup started failing. It was always one particular file that couldn't get copied and the error code was 2013.<br /><br />A number of sites from the Google indicated that it was a file permission issue on both the backup drive and the source drive. I made sure that the file was not marked as read-only, but the backup still kept failing.<br /><br />I finally stumbled upon <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101120074814/http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=201511&NewLang=en&Hilite=2013">this post</a> from the Seagate website itself.<br /><br />Per the article, I deleted the offending file from the backup drive and restarted the backup. It is now working again.
